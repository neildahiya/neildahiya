<h1>the perks of being a wallflower - Stephen Chbosky</h1>
<p>Really good book. The sort of book you can read when you&rsquo;re feeling sad/nostalgic and feel good after finishing it. I&rsquo;d already seen the movie like 10 times so everything was sort of expected, and for the first time I can&rsquo;t seem to decide which was better, the book or the movie, because the book had a more detailed story, but the movie had Emma Watson and many aesthetic scenes (yes, the pickup truck in tunnel scene). Funnily, towards the end of the book, I realized I had read it before.</p>
<p>One of the details I wish was in the movie was Michael&rsquo;s poem/note. Had to read it twice to understand what it meant. But when I did, I was just shocked, to say the least. At first, I thought it was a passage I could skip since the beginning was sort of vague, but the ending was just too good/sad/unexpected.</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s grilling of Charlie on what he should have done was also too good and seemed to be directed to me. Though this book is meant to be sad, I didn&rsquo;t feel much as I had already seen the movie and knew where this was going.</p>
<p>Favorite and most relatable passage of this book -></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;More like the movie where the guy meets a smart girl who wears a lot of sweaters and drinks cocoa. They talk about books and issues and kiss in the rain. I think something like that would be very good for him, especially if the girl were unconventionally beautiful. They are the best kind of girls, I think&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Rating: 8.5/10</strong></p>
