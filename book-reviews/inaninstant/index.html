<h1>In an Instant - Suzanne Redfearn</h1>
<p>This was a good one. It&rsquo;s a quick and really addictive read. I read in a single day. I chose to read this book as I just couldn&rsquo;t find myself reading another page of Pride and Prejudice, and the summary I read of it on Goodreads was really nice.</p>
<p>The overall theme of the book is sad but the ending is really full of redemption. The POV is really unique and I hadn&rsquo;t thought of this before. The author does a great job üëè of describing everyone&rsquo;s thought process during this entire ordeal. Sadly, the reason for this detailed description is revealed in the author&rsquo;s notes at the end of the book, in which she explains that it&rsquo;s based on a real incident which happened with her and her family.</p>
<p>The protagonist being the narrator, but still being able to describe how other&rsquo;s feel because of the unique perspective she was put in is really good. There are some passages in the book that really make you highlight them. I highlighted over 7 passages which I thought were really well written. At first I didn&rsquo;t think I would enjoy this book that much, but those passages shut those thoughts out really quickly. The book was easy to read and can definitely be chosen for a quick weekend read.</p>
<p>One of my favourite passages of this book was :</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just try to be happy when you think of me - be happy. Look at the ocean and smile. Inhale the scent and celebrate. Remember that I was never sad for more than a day. rarely for more than an hour. Carry me inside you as a light that brightens your world and makes everything better. I don&rsquo;t want to be a void, a hole, a shadow. Remember me!"</em></p>
<p><strong>Would I recommend this book to someone?</strong> Yep definitely</p>
<p><strong>Rating - 8.5/10</strong></p>
