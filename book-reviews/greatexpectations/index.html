<h1>Great Expectations</h1>
<p>This was an interesting read. Dickens' books are pretty slow, but the way the story builds up towards the end is just beautiful in all of his books I&rsquo;ve read till now. And this one surely keeps up with the trend. Though some parts of the book were predictable (like the convict&rsquo;s role in Pip falling into fortune), it was still an awesome read.</p>
<p>A bit more happy conclusion towards the end (mostly pertaining to Pip and Estella) would&rsquo;ve been nicer, but nothing wrong with what happened as well. Though her being married to that idiot definitely hurt. Also I thought Biddy would be marrying Pip at the end, but what came was sort of a nice and well deserved conclusion as well.</p>
<p>The fate of Mrs. Joe was just so so sad. She did bring Pip up by hand, but in no way did she deserve that. Orlick should&rsquo;ve faced worse consequences for what he did.</p>
<p>There were some really mind blowing parts of this novel, like the time when Mr. Jagger&rsquo;s house maid&rsquo;s story was uncovered. There was no way one could&rsquo;ve guessed that. Also the fact that Wemmick told Pip to look at her carefully finally made sense.</p>
<p>One of the most beautiful and fulfilling ends was for the convict. He died knowing that his arch enemy died, Pip was a gentlemen in the making and mainly that her daughter was alive and a Lady.</p>
<p>This book is really well written. Some of the passages could be turned into songs and have such a nice wordplay to them.</p>
<p><strong>Rating: 8.5/10</strong></p>
