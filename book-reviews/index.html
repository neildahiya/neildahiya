<h1><a href=https://neildahiya.com/book-reviews/tuesdayswithmorrie/ title="Tuesday's with Morrie - Mitch Albom">Tuesday's with Morrie - Mitch Albom</a></h1>
This is a masterpiece. If there&rsquo;s ever a book to make one cry, this is it. I can&rsquo;t possibly recommend this book enough. There hasn&rsquo;t been a book before in which I&rsquo;ve highlighted so many passages. So beautifully written and so sad at the same time.
It&rsquo;s about Morrie Schwartz, the author&rsquo;s Sociology professor. He suffers from ALS and is slowly losing the basic functioning of his body. But still, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to be lost.

<h1><a href=https://neildahiya.com/book-reviews/breakfastattiffanys/ title="Breakfast at Tiffany's - Truman Capote">Breakfast at Tiffany's - Truman Capote</a></h1>
Quick read, quotable lines, but nothing special. The story should&rsquo;ve been a bit more conclusive. Not a bad book in any way, but not great either.The book is about Holly Golightly, a Hollywood actress, magazine lover, and a sort of girl to live life to the fullest. The way she spoke was really good, but that&rsquo;s pretty much all there was to the book. The story isn&rsquo;t that intriguing. Also a bit about more about here whereabouts and her ending up with the protagonist would&rsquo;ve been better.

<h1><a href=https://neildahiya.com/book-reviews/achristmascarol/ title="A Christmas Carol - Charles Dickens">A Christmas Carol - Charles Dickens</a></h1>
If I had to describe this book in one word, it&rsquo;ll have to be &ldquo;Beautiful&rdquo; or &ldquo;Happy&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s so captivating and so well written. It&rsquo;s very different than all of Dicken&rsquo;s works I&rsquo;ve read so far, but a masterpiece indeed. A very short book, but with a great story. It can be read in a couple of hours and if you haven&rsquo;t read something in a while, it&rsquo;s a great one to start again with.

<h1><a href=https://neildahiya.com/book-reviews/greatexpectations/ title="Great Expectations - Charles Dickens">Great Expectations - Charles Dickens</a></h1>
This was an interesting read. Dickens' books are pretty slow, but the way the story builds up towards the end is just beautiful in all of his books I&rsquo;ve read till now. And this one surely keeps up with the trend. Though some parts of the book were predictable (like the convict&rsquo;s role in Pip falling into fortune), it was still an awesome read.
A bit more happy conclusion towards the end (mostly pertaining to Pip and Estella) would&rsquo;ve been nicer, but nothing wrong with what happened as well.

This was a good one. It&rsquo;s a quick and really addictive read. I read in a single day. I chose to read this book as I just couldn&rsquo;t find myself reading another page of Pride and Prejudice, and the summary I read of it on Goodreads was really nice.
The overall theme of the book is sad but the ending is really full of redemption. The POV is really unique and I hadn&rsquo;t thought of this before.

<h1><a href=https://neildahiya.com/book-reviews/prideandprejudice/ title="Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen">Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen</a></h1>
Read around 70-80 pages and couldn&rsquo;t make myself go through it any longer. The book is so damn slow and boring. Yeah, the title is sort of justified, but not an easy read in any way (IMO).
Rating: NA

<h1><a href=https://neildahiya.com/book-reviews/vicious/ title="Vicious - V.E. Schwab">Vicious - V.E. Schwab</a></h1>
This was a less serious book than the ones I&rsquo;ve read before. I have read several fiction books but none like this (supernatural/fantasy). The best thing about this book was the author&rsquo;s way of writing. It was crystal clear, easy to understand and very unique. The reader got to know about two different times at the same time, alternating every chapter. There was a 12 year gap in every alternate chapter at the beginning and the story in both seemed to lead to the other.

<h1><a href=https://neildahiya.com/book-reviews/diaryofayounggirl/ title="Diary of a young girl - Anne Frank">Diary of a young girl - Anne Frank</a></h1>
This was a special book. It&rsquo;s not really a novel but an actual record of events by a 13 year old girl who ended up being the victim of the holocaust. Should one expect this book to be perfect? Absolutely not, it isn&rsquo;t meant to be perfect. One also can&rsquo;t expect good writing from a 13 year old going through one of the greatest tragedies on the face of the planet.

The correct way to describe this book would be sad. So many people die. That seems to be the overall theme of the book. I even considered leaving this book half way through but picked it up again because its so beautifully written. It&rsquo;s sad for sure but makes you wanna keep on reading or thinking about what&rsquo;s gonna happen next. Why do most of the books either start or end with a death.
