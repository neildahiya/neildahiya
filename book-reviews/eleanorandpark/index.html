<meta name=twitter:description content="Not a good book. Can&rsquo;t possibly recommend this. There&rsquo;s just no story build-up. Everything is slow and inconclusive. The ending is neither sad nor happy. Again inconclusive. No lines I wanted to highlight. No passages with too much feel. It was an average read at best. In the end, there should&rsquo;ve been some consequences for all Eleanor&rsquo;s step-father did to her. Or at least they should&rsquo;ve ended up together. It was way too predictable what was going to happen at the end.">

<p>Not a good book. Can&rsquo;t possibly recommend this. There&rsquo;s just no story build-up. Everything is slow and inconclusive. The ending is neither sad nor happy. Again inconclusive.
