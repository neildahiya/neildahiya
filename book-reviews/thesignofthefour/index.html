<h1>Sherlock Holmes : The Sign Of The Four - Arthur Conan Doyle</h1>
<p>This was a pretty interesting read. Also an easy read. Being an admirer of the Sherlock Holmes movies and the TV series, this was right up my alley. The portrayal of Sherlock by Watson is so damn good. Though I was surprised to see characters like Major Sholto and Mary Morstan being so different than the TV series.</p>
<p>One thing I found that could be done better was the ending of the book. The end should&rsquo;ve been faster and should&rsquo;ve had more suspense towards it. The story by the wooden-legged man seemed to be explained a bit too much. Not sure if it was even required. Also in the middle of the book, Sherlock almost completely describes what happened. Yes, that&rsquo;s expected from a Sherlock Holmes novel but I think this could&rsquo;ve been kept as a secret till the end. Also, how does Mar go from holding Watson&rsquo;s hand to marriage so quickly?</p>
