<h1>Norwegian Wood - Haruki Murakami</h1>
<p>The correct way to describe this book would be sad. So many people die. That seems to be the overall theme of the book. I even considered leaving this book half way through but picked it up again because its so beautifully written. It&rsquo;s sad for sure but makes you wanna keep on reading or thinking about what&rsquo;s gonna happen next. Why do most of the books either start or end with a death. The ending is just heartbreaking, but it was building up to that point from the beginning.</p>
<p>Another underlying theme of this book is sex. Sex is described so many times, from start to the end, that it gets to be a bit disturbing a few times. Murakami is a pervert for sure.</p>
<p>One unique thing about this book is the way everything is described (in a very Japanese/aesthetic way). The music referenced is good which should&rsquo;ve been clear from the title. But the way the title haunts the reader at the end is just cruel.</p>
<p>Another thing I felt after reading the book is how a single person&rsquo;s bad decision affect so many people. No one should ever take that option. A single person&rsquo;s bad decision affected 5 people here.</p>
<p>Would I read another Murakami? Yes, definitely, but not immediately. I need some time away from the sad novels.</p>
<p><strong>Rating - 9/10</strong></p>
