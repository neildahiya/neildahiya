This was an interesting read. Dickens' books are pretty slow, but the way the story builds up towards the end is just beautiful in all of his books I've read till now. And this one surely keeps up with the trend. Though some parts of the book were predictable (like the convict's role in Pip falling into fortune), it was still an awesome read. 

A bit more happy conclusion towards the end (mostly pertaining to Pip and Estella) would've been nicer, but nothing wrong with what happened as well. Though her being married to that idiot definitely hurt. Also I thought Biddy would be marrying Pip at the end, but what came was sort of a nice and well deserved conclusion as well. 

The fate of Mrs. Joe was just so so sad. She did bring Pip up by hand, but in no way did she deserve that. Orlick should've faced worse consequences for what he did.

There were some really mind blowing parts of this novel, like the time when Mr. Jagger's house maid's story was uncovered. There was no way one could've guessed that. Also the fact that Wemmick told Pip to look at her carefully finally made sense. 

One of the most beautiful and fulfilling ends was for the convict. He died knowing that his arch enemy died, Pip was a gentlemen in the making and mainly that her daughter was alive and a Lady. 

This book is really well written. Some of the passages could be turned into songs and have such a nice wordplay to them.

**Rating: 8.5/10**
