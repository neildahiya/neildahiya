Title = "Norwegian Wood - Haruki Murakami"

+++
The correct way to describe this book would be sad. So many people die. That seems to be the overall theme of the book. I even considered leaving this book half way through but picked it up again because its so beautifully written. It's sad for sure but makes you wanna keep on reading or thinking about what's gonna happen next. Why do most of the books either start or end with a death. The ending is just heartbreaking, but it was building up to that point from the beginning.

Another underlying theme of this book is sex. Sex is described so many times, from start to the end, that it gets to be a bit disturbing a few times. Murakami is a pervert for sure. 

One unique thing about this book is the way everything is described (in a very Japanese/aesthetic way). The music referenced is good which should've been clear from the title. But the way the title haunts the reader at the end is just cruel.

Another thing I felt after reading the book is how a single person's bad decision affect so many people. No one should ever take that option. A single person's bad decision affected 5 people here. 

Would I read another Murakami? Yes, definitely, but not immediately. I need some time away from the sad novels.

**Rating - 9/10**
