Why did I read this book? Because of a song I heard. Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush. The song is really really awesome. It's a unique song that prompted me to read up about it. That's how I came across this book. Shockingly, the book is not about ghosts as I imagined when watching the video of the songðŸ˜‚. The central theme of this book is manipulation and cruelty. Almost every character is manipulative at some point or the other.   

The story is about two households - Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. The residents of Wuthering Heights are Mr. Earnshaw, his two children Hindley and Catherine, Heathcliff (a boy Mr. Earnshaw found in his travels), and many servants. The residents of Thrushcross Grange are the Lintons. 

Heathcliff was a silent kind. He used to keep to himself and was adored by Mr. Earnshaw and Catherine. He was despised by Hindley, and rightly so. Heathcliff was manipulative from the beginning. The only ones who couldn't see this were Mr. Earnshaw and Cathrine. When Mr. Earnshaw died, Hindley got all of the estate
