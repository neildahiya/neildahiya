This was a good one. It's a quick and really addictive read. I read in a single day. I chose to read this book as I just couldn't find myself reading another page of Pride and Prejudice, and the summary I read of it on Goodreads was really nice.

The overall theme of the book is sad but the ending is really full of redemption. The POV is really unique and I hadn't thought of this before. The author does a great job üëè of describing everyone's thought process during this entire ordeal. Sadly, the reason for this  detailed description is revealed in the author's notes at the end of the book, in which she explains that it's based on a real incident which happened with her and her family.

The protagonist being the narrator, but still being able to describe how other's feel because of the unique perspective she was put in is really good. There are some passages in the book that really make you highlight them. I highlighted over 7 passages which I thought were really well written. At first I didn't think I would enjoy this book that much, but those passages shut those thoughts out really quickly. The book was easy to read and can definitely be chosen for a quick weekend read.

One of my favourite passages of this book was :

_"Don't just try to be happy when you think of me - be happy. Look at the ocean and smile. Inhale the scent and celebrate. Remember that I was never sad for more than a day. rarely for more than an hour. Carry me inside you as a light that brightens your world and makes everything better. I don't want to be a void, a hole, a shadow. Remember me!"_

**Would I recommend this book to someone?** Yep definitely

**Rating - 8.5/10**
