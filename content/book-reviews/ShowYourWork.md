Title = "Show Your Work - Austin Kleon"

+++
This is the first audiobook I've read/consumed, which made me realize audiobooks are great, but not for self-help books. I couldn't highlight anything when I wanted to and couldn't take notes. But the book itself was pretty good and engaging. It's basically promoting the _#buildinpublic_ moment everyone is talking about on Twitter nowadays. 

The key takeaways from this book are:- 

* Being a genius isn't a necessity - Oftentimes, amateurs get better results than experts at a particular art because to them, there are no rules/preconceptions. Being an amateur shouldn't stop one to do something and show it.
* Think Process and not Product - This means committing to the process of anything you're trying to accomplish rather than focusing on the result you want. An example of this would be committing to playing the guitar 30 mins a day, even if you play shit, and rather than analyzing every day how bad you still are. Over time, the process would yield results.
* Share something every day, learn to tell good stories.
* Teach what you know
* Learn to take a punch - People might criticize your work when you're sharing it every step of the way. Categorize which people actually matter. If they're not someone who tries to improve you / your product / add value to the conversation and comment just for the sake of commenting, their comment is not worth pondering over. 
* Stick around - Don't quit. You'll have good and bad days. But just keep on putting out / sharing the work. Work is never finished, just abandoned. You can't count on success but can leave open a possibility for it (from your work) and jump on the first opportunity you get.

I can't remember much else as I couldn't highlight anything. But would definitely recommend this book.
