Title = "Tuesday's with Morrie - Mitch Albom"

+++
This is a masterpiece. If there's ever a book to make one cry, this is it. I can't possibly recommend this book enough. There hasn't been a book before in which I've highlighted so many passages. So beautifully written and so sad at the same time.

It's about Morrie Schwartz, the author's Sociology professor. He suffers from ALS and is slowly losing the basic functioning of his body. But still, he doesn't seem to be lost. His way of looking at the life he has left is so so good. The stuff written in this book couldn't possibly be made up. This book is the final class the author took with Morrie, in his study at his home, and surely the most important class he ever took (and we as readers have the privilege of attending thanks to him).

Morrie really puts into perspective what's important and what's not. When living through such a dire situation, what does and doesn't matter really shines through. 

If you can shell out 3 hours of your time, read this. Read this and there's no way in hell that you wouldn't be moved. So many lessons in this book that one must know and understand. Quite possibly the best book I've ever read, even though it was a small read.

**Rating: 10/10**
