Title = "Breakfast at Tiffany's - Truman Capote"

Quick read, quotable lines, but nothing special. The story should've been a bit more conclusive. Not a bad book in any way, but not great either.The book is about Holly Golightly, a Hollywood actress, magazine lover, and a sort of girl to live life to the fullest. The way she spoke was really good, but that's pretty much all there was to the book. The story isn't that intriguing. Also a bit about more about here whereabouts and her ending up with the protagonist would've been better.

**Rating: 6.5/10**
