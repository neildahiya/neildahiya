Title = "Diary of a young girl - Anne Frank"

+++
This was a special book. It's not really a novel but an actual record of events by a 13 year old girl who ended up being the victim of the holocaust. Should one expect this book to be perfect? Absolutely not, it isn't meant to be perfect. One also can't expect good writing from a 13 year old going through one of the greatest tragedies on the face of the planet. But does she deliver? 100% yes. It's a heart breaking collection of someone's memories, someone who was full of life and found a way to express herself by means of this diary and gave the outside world a glance in the life of Jews during that horrible time.

The diary is written beautifully. I still can't comprehend how a 13 year old could write like this. How was she so consistent and so honest to herself? The way she sometimes accepted her own fault (like the letter to her father) was so mature and can't possibly be expected from someone so young. If I would have been in her place, I couldn't possibly continue writing for so much time, considering the circumstances she was facing.

People were so frustrated because of the Covid lockdown in just a month. It's difficult to even think how she and countless others had to live in those horrible circumstances, with no way to reach the outside world. She definitely was way mature for her age.

The diary isn't actually very sad in itself, but the fact that the reader knows what's coming makes it so so much sadder. It would be really common if the reader keeps on checking the date on the last chapter to see how much time is left for that horrible conclusion. It's impossible not to be sad reading this book and the way it abruptly ends because they got arrested is just so heartbreaking.

Another sad thing about this book is the aftermath that's written after the diary ends. The fact that Anne died only a few days before the camp was liberated almost makes one wanna cry.

**Would I recommend this book to someone?** 100% Yes. Everyone should read this diary at least once.

**Rating - 10/10**
