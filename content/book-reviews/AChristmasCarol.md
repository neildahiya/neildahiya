Title = "A Christmas Carol"

+++
If I had to describe this book in one word, it'll have to be "Beautiful" or "Happy". It's so captivating and so well written. It's very different than all of Dicken's works I've read so far, but a masterpiece indeed. A very short book, but with a great story. It can be read in a couple of hours and if you haven't read something in a while, it's a great one to start again with. 

It'll definitely put you in a festive mood. The drastic change in Scrooge's character from the beginning to the end is just so satisfying to read. Though it's a quick read, it has some really great passages.   
  
_"I wear the chain I forged in life. I made it link-by-link, and yard by yard; I girded it on my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it."_

_"When men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys."_

Nothing much to review about this book, without giving away the entire plot.

**Rating: 10/10**
