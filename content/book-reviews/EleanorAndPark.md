Title = "Eleanor and Park - Rainbow Rowell"

+++
Not a good book. Can't possibly recommend this. There's just no story build-up. Everything is slow and inconclusive. The ending is neither sad nor happy. Again inconclusive. No lines I wanted to highlight. No passages with too much feel. It was an average read at best. In the end, there should've been some consequences for all Eleanor's step-father did to her. Or at least they should've ended up together. It was way too predictable what was going to happen at the end.

**Rating: 4/10**
