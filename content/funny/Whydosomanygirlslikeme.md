Title = "Why do so many girls like me?"

+++
Have you ever felt that you’re the only one in this world with a certain problem? I was just struck with the same feeling. But unlike your problems, mine is just too serious. It feels like a nightmare, every other girl you see wants to have you. I often look up some famous people and what they have to say regarding this conundrum but being the intellectual that I am, I can’t stay quiet about some bat shit crazy stuff they’ve said about girls. The point in case the infamous Gandhi quote.

People usually commend Gandhi for all his work, but some of his quotes are a bit contentious —

If I wasn’t such an alpha male (who has no trouble getting girls), I would’ve agreed with this statement, but that just ain’t me. Gandhi was really wrong in making this statement. I mean seriously, the girls aren’t in the wrong here. They obviously can’t resist someone (irresistible) like me, someone who oozes the alpha trait. Maybe Gandhi was a beta himself.

I know none of you will ever face such a problem, but if there is an upcoming “one-in-a-billion” alpha male like me, I got some tips to share totally free of cost(next article — Is generosity flowing in my veins?).

**_Tips_**

1. Respect Girls — This goes without saying, but every day I see countless men not respecting women. This is unacceptable. Women need respect just like plants need water. This image accurately depicts this point.

2. Don’t be polite — You might think “Oh he means stuff like opening the door for women”, well that's what a beta cuck would think. Let her open her own goddamn doors. Opening the door for her just makes her think she’s weak and not able to open the door. Same with pulling out the chair for them at the restaurant. They can do that themselves.
3. Plan your day— Now you might be wondering, what to do all day? Well, worry not, cause I already have it all planned out. You follow this schedule and believe me, you won’t need to slide into girl’s DMs. They will slide into your bed.

_Now the question you all might be asking — “How do I be like him?” —_

To be completely honest, which I always am(upcoming article — Is it the truth that's flowing in my veins?), you can’t be like me. Each individual is unique, and might I add, inferior to me. So please give up on that.

_Understandable, but how do you deal with all this?_

To answer this question, you need to know about two more qualities of mine(and believe me, I got a lot more) — Determination & Generosity. It’s my generosity that prevents me to say no to any woman. And it's my determination that compels me to show each of those women a nice time. After all, why should my qualities hurt those women? I’m a true believer in love and I believe love comes in many forms, sometimes in form of 1 woman, & sometimes in form of multiple women.
